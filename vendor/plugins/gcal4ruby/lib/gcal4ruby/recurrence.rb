    #and as the value, an array containing zero to n of the following:
    #- *Secondly*: A value between 0 and 59.  Causes the event to repeat on that second of each minut.
    #- *Minutely*: A value between 0 and 59.  Causes the event to repeat on that minute of every hour.
    #- *Hourly*: A value between 0 and 23.  Causes the even to repeat on that hour of every day.
    #- *Daily*: No value needed - will cause the event to repeat every day until the repeat_until date.
    #- *Weekly*: A value of the first two letters of a day of the week.  Causes the event to repeat on that day.
    #- *Monthly*: A value of a positive or negative integer (i.e. +1) prepended to a day-of-week string ('TU') to indicate the position of the day within the month.  E.g. +1TU would be the first tuesday of the month.
    #- *Yearly*: A value of 1 to 366 indicating the day of the year.  May be negative to indicate counting down from the last day of the year.
    #
    #Optionally, you may specific a second hash pair to set the internal the even repeats:
    #   "interval" => '2'
    #If the interval is missing, it is assumed to be 1.
    #
    #===Examples
    #Repeat event every Tuesday:
    #   frequency = {"Weekly" => ["TU"]}
    #
    #Repeat every first and third Monday of the month
    #   frequency = {"Monthly" => ["+1MO", "+3MO"]}
    #
    #Repeat on the last day of every year
    #   frequency = {"Yearly" => [366]}
    #
    #Repeat every other week on Friday
    #   frequency = {"Weekly" => ["FR"], "interval" => "2"}
